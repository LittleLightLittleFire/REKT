Liquidations will continue until morale improves
Everything changed when the fire nation attacked
Give them nothing, but take from them, EVERYTHING
Not even the market manipulators can save you now
The only way to fix this is to use higher leverage
Protip: it really hurts to have to your margin blown
If you can dodge a liquidation you can dodge anything
You want the position? You can't handle the position!
Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?
Learn from other people's mistakes, it's less expensive
You exists as we allow it, you will end as we demand it
Confidence born of ignorance, the cycle cannot be broken

For what? Liquidate me for what? I thought this was America!
They sent me to liquidation, I sent them to the Shadow Realm
The crime is moving against the market, the sentence is death
Remember when I said I was going to liquidate you last? I lied
Why be alive if you don‚Äôt even try to do something remarkable?
I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!

You merely adopted to the ocean, I was born in it, moulded by it
If you liked this losing position so much why don't you marry it?
It's not l-like I w-wanted to get l-liquidated or-r anything! Baka!
It's a shame that this position won't live but then again whose does?
There's no shame in being wrong, only failing to correct our mistakes
On a long enough timeline the survival rate for everyone goes to zero
"Whale" a label created by traders to give voice to their destruction
