It brings back PTSD from that sand casino
There are no regrets in life, just lessons
Will somebody please think of the children
If only you knew how bad things really are.
It's not a loss if you don't get liquidated
It's over! The whales have the high ground!
Every day we stray further from God's light
I hurt myself today; to see if I still feel
One does not simply move against the market
When you make an absolutely abhorrent trade
Where will you be when liquidation strikes?
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
Only the dead can know peace from this evil.
Sometimes my genius, it's almost frightening
Dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives
You got a boyfriend I bet he doesn't kiss ya!

Give them nothing, but take from them, EVERYTHING
Now is not the time for fear... That comes later!
Not even the market manipulators can save you now
he actually did it the absolute madman hahahahahah
The only way to fix this is to use higher leverage
When the MM makes you feel like a little girl again
There's nothing more frustrating than starting over
Protip: it really hurts to have to your margin blown
Did you do it? Yes. What did it cost? ... Everything
In the end, we only regret the chances we didn‚Äôt take
If you can dodge a liquidation you can dodge anything
You want the position? You can't handle the position!
Jokes on them, I was merely pretending to be retarded.
You won't believe what we found in the suicide forest!
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened
Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?
Remember when I promised to liquidate you last? I lied
You exist as we allow it, you will end as we demand it
Of all the flavours in the world you chose liquidation
(Note: Poochie died on the way back to his home planet)

All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain
You either die a hero or live long enough to become a meme
Thank you for assuming the party escort submission position
At least you aren't bagholding that losing position anymore
Before us, you are nothing, your liquidation was inevitable
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege trading with you tonight
The money was not lost, it just belongs to someone else now
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to trade crypto
For what? Liquidate me for what? I thought this was America!
They sent me to liquidation, I sent them to the Shadow Realm
This position does not spark joy for me, so it'll have to go!
Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe
The crime is moving against the market, the sentence is death
Why be alive if you don‚Äôt even try to do something remarkable?
I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
You will live to see man-made horrors beyond your comprehension
I tried so hard, I came so far, in the end it didn't even matter
* (The sudden loss of your margin fills you with DETERMINATION.)
You merely adopted to the ocean, I was born in it, moulded by it
We trade, we degen, we lose it all and we make it all back again
If you liked this losing position so much why don't you marry it?
We built this exchange for a certain kind of person, to hurt them

His palms sweaty, knees weak, there's vomit on his sweater already
The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent
It's not l-like I w-wanted to get l-liquidated or-r anything! Baka!
It was futile to try, the Bitmex liquidation engine cannot overload.
It's a shame that this position won't live but then again whose does?

hide your kids, hide your wife, cause they‚Äôre liquidatin‚Äô everybody out here
It was said that the powers of the MM could even save people from liquidation
Liquidate me once, shame on you, liquidate me - you can't get liquidated again.
Hahahah How The Fuck Is Getting Liquidated Possible LMAO Like Just Close The Trade
And on your Facebook memorial page they'll write you died free and happy, I'm sure.
What's the hardest part about holding this position? Telling your parents you're gay
Knock knock, open up the door it's real. With the non-stop pop pop of stainless steel.
Down here salt is a way of life, when you breathe that in you can constantly taste the salt.
I must apologize for this trader, he is an idiot. We have purposely trained him wrong, as a joke.
I'm burning through the sky / Yeah! / Two hundred degrees / That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
Sal couldn't close his position before he was cleaned for his life savings making him tonight's big loser.
it was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness
His soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment.
The traders are rage, brutal, without mercy. But you, the MM. You will be worse. Rip and tear, until it is done!
When Bitmex sends its traders, they're not sending their best, they‚Äôre sending people that have lots of problems
