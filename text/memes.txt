Make trading great again
Have we started the fire?
Fear is only in our minds
Has trading gone too far?
I bet the whales did this
Whales Gon' Give It To Ya
What did he mean by this?
Winning is too mainstream
Suffering builds character
Much that once was is lost
You activated my trap card
Cancel the lambo pre-orders
Only casuals get liquidated
I live, I die, I live again!
I had to fall to lose it all
I am the one who liquidates!
ROW! ROW! / FIGHT THE POWER!
One last trip, to Flavortown
Wow, what a terrific audience
Another soul has been claimed
'Cause baby you're a firework

In the end it didn't even matter
‚ô´ How could this happen to me? ‚ô´
Remember me as I was not as I am
This isn't even 2% of my account
You're not even close to baseline
"git gud or die tryin'" - Socrates
Pssh... Nothin Personnel... Kid...
First they came for the bad traders
Not like this ... not like this ...
Consequences will never be the same
But that was when I ruled the world
Someone get this hothead outta here!
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Congratulations, you played yourself
I volunteer! I volunteer as tribute!
Outta luck, outta time, outta margin
Shhhh no more tears, only dreams now
You traded in the wrong neighborhood
Bad things happen to bad traders too!
FUCK YOU DOLPHIN!!! FUCK YOU WHALE!!!
You're going to need a bigger account
You'll ride eternal, shiny and chrome!
Where we're going, we don't need stops
Was being liquidated part of your plan?
Crashing this plane, WITH NO SURVIVORS!
What are you going to do? Liquidate me?
Show me on this doll where they hurt you
If you ain't whale, you're little people
"Just fuck my shit up" "Say no more fam"
My ancestors are smiling at me Imperials
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
You Get Nothing! You Lose! Good Day, Sir!
There are no regrets in life, just lessons
Will somebody please think of the children
They expect one of us the wreckage brother
Every day we stray further from God's light
If I liquidate this position, will you die?
I hurt myself today; to see if I still feel
One does not simply move against the market
When you make an absolutely abhorrent trade
Where will you be when liquidation strikes?
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
Dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
Bitmex liquidation engine is your new God now
The WHALE walks into a bar. There's no counter
In time, you will know what it is like to lose
The virgin "trader" vs the Chad "market maker"
How it possible that $SYMBOL moves up AND down?
I didn't choose this trade, this trade chose me

You call yourself a trader, you son of a bitch?
When you're out of margin who are going to call?
Fly me to the moon / Let me play among the stars
Somebody Once Told Me The World Is Gonna Roll Me
Liquidations will continue until morale improves
Everything changed when the fire nation attacked
Give them nothing, but take from them, EVERYTHING
Now is not the time for fear... That comes later!
Not even the market manipulators can save you now
The only way to fix this is to use higher leverage
There's nothing more frustrating than starting over
Protip: it really hurts to have to your margin blown
In the end, we only regret the chances we didn‚Äôt take
If you can dodge a liquidation you can dodge anything
When I'm done, half of all positions will still exist
You want the position? You can't handle the position!
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened
Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?
Remember when I promised to liquidate you last? I lied
Learn from other people's mistakes, it's less expensive
You exists as we allow it, you will end as we demand it
Pretending to be a good trader is absolutely exhausting
Confidence born of ignorance, the cycle cannot be broken
Rule #1: Never lose money. Rule #2: Never forget rule #1
Never go against a whale when liquidation is on the line
When the mark price hits the liquidation price just right
All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain
You either die a hero or live long enough to become a meme
Thank you for assuming the party escort submission position
At least you aren't bagholding that losing position anymore
Before us, you are nothing, your liquidation was inevitable
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege trading with you tonight
The money was not lost, it just belongs to someone else now
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to trade crypto
The market tips toward equilibrium because of your sacrifice
For what? Liquidate me for what? I thought this was America!
They sent me to liquidation, I sent them to the Shadow Realm
Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe
The crime is moving against the market, the sentence is death
Why be alive if you don‚Äôt even try to do something remarkable?
I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
* (The sudden loss of your margin fills you with DETERMINATION.)
You merely adopted to the ocean, I was born in it, moulded by it
If you liked this losing position so much why don't you marry it?
We built this exchange for a certain kind of person, to hurt them
To feel so desperately that you're right and to fail all the same
His palms sweaty, knees weak, there's vomit on his sweater already
It's not l-like I w-wanted to get l-liquidated or-r anything! Baka!
It's a shame that this position won't live but then again whose does?
There's no shame in being wrong, only failing to correct our mistakes
On a long enough timeline the survival rate for everyone goes to zero
"Whale" a label created by traders to give voice to their destruction
Smile, for even in liquidation, you have become children of the market
