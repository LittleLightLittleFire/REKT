Don't hate the player, hate the game
Congratulations, you played yourself
I volunteer! I volunteer as tribute!
Outta luck, outta time, outta margin

You traded in the wrong neighborhood
Bad things happen to bad traders too!
FUCK YOU DOLPHIN!!! FUCK YOU WHALE!!!
You're going to need a bigger account
You've advanced a new level in Losses
This is going in my cringe compilation
I'm going to pretend I didn't see that
Does this look like the face or mercy?
You'll ride eternal, shiny and chrome!
Where we're going, we don't need stops

Was being liquidated part of your plan?
Crashing this plane, WITH NO SURVIVORS!
What are you going to do? Liquidate me?
Show me on this doll where they hurt you

My ancestors are smiling at me Imperials
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
How could the market manipulators do this
You Get Nothing! You Lose! Good Day, Sir!
When the MM doesn't respect your safeword
It brings back PTSD from that sand casino
There are no regrets in life, just lessons
Will somebody please think of the children
It's not a loss if you don't get liquidated
It's over! The whales have the high ground!
Every day we stray further from God's light
I hurt myself today; to see if I still feel
One does not simply move against the market
When you make an absolutely abhorrent trade
Where will you be when liquidation strikes?
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
Only the dead can know peace from this evil.
Dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives
Maybe they'll turn you into a Fortnite dance.
You got a boyfriend I bet he doesn't kiss ya!
They expect one of us in the wreckage brother
How can losses be real if Bitcoin isn't real.
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

Liquidations will continue until morale improves
Everything changed when the fire nation attacked
When the MM tears you a new asshole #JustMMThings
When you gain a deeper understanding of suffering
Give them nothing, but take from them, EVERYTHING
Now is not the time for fear... That comes later!
Not even the market manipulators can save you now
he actually did it the absolute madman hahahahahah
The only way to fix this is to use higher leverage
When the MM makes you feel like a little girl again
There's nothing more frustrating than starting over
Protip: it really hurts to have to your margin blown
Did you do it? Yes. What did it cost? ... Everything
In the end, we only regret the chances we didn’t take
If you can dodge a liquidation you can dodge anything
You want the position? You can't handle the position!
You won't believe what we found in the suicide forest!
Of all the flavours in the world you chose liquidation
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened
Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?
Remember when I promised to liquidate you last? I lied
You exist as we allow it, you will end as we demand it
Learn from other people's mistakes, it's less expensive
Pretending to be a good trader is absolutely exhausting
Believe in something, even if it means losing everything
Confidence born of ignorance, the cycle cannot be broken
Rule #1: Never lose money. Rule #2: Never forget rule #1
Never go against a whale when liquidation is on the line
When a trade makes you pontificate on the meaning of life
When the mark price hits the liquidation price just right
Friendship ended with gains, losses are my new best friend
All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain
You either die a hero or live long enough to become a meme
Thank you for assuming the party escort submission position
At least you aren't bagholding that losing position anymore
Before us, you are nothing, your liquidation was inevitable
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege trading with you tonight
The money was not lost, it just belongs to someone else now
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to trade crypto
For what? Liquidate me for what? I thought this was America!
They sent me to liquidation, I sent them to the Shadow Realm
Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe
The crime is moving against the market, the sentence is death
Why be alive if you don’t even try to do something remarkable?
I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
I tried so hard, I came so far, in the end it didn't even matter
* (The sudden loss of your margin fills you with DETERMINATION.)
You merely adopted to the ocean, I was born in it, moulded by it
If you liked this losing position so much why don't you marry it?
We built this exchange for a certain kind of person, to hurt them
To feel so desperately that you are right and to fail all the same
His palms sweaty, knees weak, there's vomit on his sweater already
It's not l-like I w-wanted to get l-liquidated or-r anything! Baka!
It was futile to try, the Bitmex liquidation engine cannot overload.
It's a shame that this position won't live but then again whose does?
There's no shame in being wrong, only failing to correct our mistakes
On a long enough timeline the survival rate for everyone goes to zero
"Whale" a label created by traders to give voice to their destruction
For what is a man, what has he got? / If not himself then he has naught
hide your kids, hide your wife, cause they’re liquidatin’ everybody out here
It was said that the powers of the MM could even save people from liquidation
Liquidate me once, shame on you, liquidate me - you can't get liquidated again.
Trading Like A Degenerate Got This Trader Liquidated (and Why It's a Good Thing)
Hahahah How The Fuck Is Getting Liquidated Possible LMAO Like Just Close The Trade
And on your Facebook memorial page they'll write you died free and happy, I'm sure.
Down here salt is a way of life, when you breathe that in you can constantly taste the salt.
I'm burning through the sky / Yeah! / Two hundred degrees / That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
Sal couldn't close his position before he was cleaned for his life savings making him tonight's big loser.
it was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness
His soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment.
The traders are rage, brutal, without mercy. But you, the MM. You will be worse. Rip and tear, until it is done!
When Bitmex sends its traders, they're not sending their best, they’re sending people that have lots of problems
